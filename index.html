                I voraciously read encyclopedias at age 10 & thought a lot about quantum principles, stumbling upon the idea of the Ruliad & Hyperuliad: the configuration of the 
                world and the way the emes arranged themselves is never the same. My paths diverged from the path laid out to me when I decided to permanently relocate to the U.S.
                Growing up seeing my uncle's conglomerate business empire ruthlessly gave out unfair terms to entrepreneurs to crush competition and maintain his monopoly position, 
                it fueled me with a passion to help entrepreneurs for life.

                Growing up and constantly seeing inefficiencies in a country overshadowed by the greed of politicians, I constantly tried to search for some type of rule
                and structure that would help me make sense of the seemingly random and chaotic universe. I found that in Stephen Wolfram and Metamathematics.

                Lil Durk - All My Life ft. J. Cole summarize the imposter syndrome I felt my entire life surrounded by men that constantly doubted me and my intellect. 
                My mother was one of the few educated woman in my country who did a PhD on genome studies, and was forced to give up her job to be a better "housewife."
                That sinewy, shadow of death followed me to silicon valley, where I constantly felt like I would do anything to not look the way I did so I could be just listened 
                to for my ideas and accepted for me. A high thought I once had: what if the world is inverted – what if there are people that are living their lives in parallel 
                to ours but they occupy a different dimension, and perhaps they can see us, but we as observers embedded within the ruliad, cannot see the hyperuliad. 
                As an endlessly curious person growing up, I observed how there are superpositions across various religions around the world.

            <p contenteditable="true">
                This made me think that<br>
                our ideas of god could have derived<br>
                from aliens with alien intelligence<br>
                who have came down to earth at an earlier time in life,<br>
                and could access dimensions we cannot see from our fishbowl.

                Even though I looked popular to everyone, I always felt so different inside. My favorite childhood actor 
                Chad Michael Murray, famous quote that I lived by my entire time in high school: "I can be surrounded by a sea of people and still feel all alone." 
                I am so glad to have mentors along the way who have taught me that being different, especially in finance can help you find arbitrage opportunities. 
                I applied for Stern because I was extremely interested in game strategy, and got the amazing opportunity to learn directly from the professor who previously 
                worked at the Council of Economic Advisers. For the Business Law class, I got to go to the New York Supreme Court and write a paper on an actual hearing 
                – it was a breach of contract case on wall street. That changed my mind so much that I ended up interning for a congressman, and also thought about going to law school 
                (was the youngest person in my LSAT class). But I gave all that up after a corporate lawyer at stern advising us told me not to go down the law route. Long hours. Boring job. Forget it, 
                she said.
