                I voraciously read encyclopedias at age 10 & thought a lot about quantum principles, stumbling upon the sci-fi idea that our ideas of god 
                could derive from aliens with alien intelligence who have came down to earth an earlier time in life, and could access dimensions we cannot see from our fishbowl. 
                I thought this was merely sci-fi, but I came up with the same principle of the Ruliad & Hyperruliad that Stephen Wolfram did long ago in a dictatorship country where nobody 
                did anything like this, let alone girls. You have no idea how many times men there have told me that I should be in the kitchen instead 
                of sitting as the only girl in AP Calculus with them. Oh, and I skipped my sexist AP Cal class mainly because of the senioritis after getting into stern lol, 
                but got a 5 anyways. I was the only one, and that sexist boy ended up as a broke DJ.

              I have always been interested in game strategy (prediction markets, poker, politics, gaming) and finding the underlying rule/structure behind dynamic, stochastic, noisy and complex system.

            I went to an agi hackathon about the largest virtual cell training and discovered something interesting that could be done with transfer learning to uncover fundamental laws and structures (stephen wolfram concept of us as observers simply sampling from a part of the ruliad accessible to us) of any systems whether that was biological or financial.

            But silicon valley let a bad taste in my mouth. Most men rarely looked at me as more than a good-looking girl that was too preppy and 
            too non-technical to belong or sit in their circles. I rekindled my love for math and physics and taught myself to build AI models
            because all my co-founders sexualized the shit out of me, and I sat there in front of a NFX female partner asking me why I dont have a co-founder. 
            She was telling me how amazing it was to have a "WOMAN" entrepreneur, so I couldn't bare to utter that my perfect google AI PHD co-founder ended 
            up just flexing his muscles at me the whole time that I thought the VCs would never respect me if I partnered with this kid. Which is why I love hedge funds. 
            Money is honest. Money makes people honest, and I don't think I can take any more pretense or the mirage of the silicon valley kids who think 
            entrepreneurship is a sleeve to wear on their resume.

            I met someone different though, who was exactly like me, although he was born on the other side of the world. When I was digging into 
            black holes on my own, he figured out how to theroetically travel to black hole, and many other ideas that we collided and collaborated on. 
            He was the only person that saw behind my exterior, and the only person who truly loved innovation, experimentation and discovery like i did. 
            Thanks to him, I got to rekindle my love for quantum physics & Metamethematics.
